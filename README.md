## Development Features

- Made by flutter so it can work on both ios/android with possibility to make it work on windows, web.. 
- Developed with MVC (Model - View - Controller) Architecture, so it gives you more freedom and organization for folders, assets, files... 
- Well commented and organized
- Easy change to colors (from AppColors class) 
- All texts that has nothing with app data cn be modified from one file( AppTexts class ) 
- Divising app by components so it can be reusable
- In app local data with pre-processing it for user experience( so it's no need to load from server, because the idea here that there no need to globally load to data, you ca manage it however you want by making a new Model for anything you need to move and linking it to the app )
